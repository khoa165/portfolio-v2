              <p>During my first semester in college, I enrolled in an introductory course of programming. I recall myself struggling to understand basic concepts such as methods and data types. Weekly programming was indeed a huge challenge for me as I was not able to apply what I learned into practice. Aware of that, I started taking a more proactive approach in learning and I visited Professorsâ€™ office hours weekly to ensure I fully understood every concept I learned in class. By the end of the course, I realized I enjoyed coding more than I expected, especially working through the big program assignments. I coded a classic game of Sokoban and built a simple chat bot with instructions from the Professors.</p>
              <p>I recall spending the winter break after that researching more about the opportunities and career paths that Computer Science major offers. Set on becoming a software developer in the future, I went on to take the second course in the programming sequence. During the weekend, I took what I learned from class projects to another level and spent time coding small silly games using Java and Processing graphic library. I took advantages of Spring break to work on personal projects as well as learning new technological tools, starting with HTML and CSS.</p>
              <p>I grew up pursuing the education in Vietnam, where I tried to study all 12 subjects equally well and ended up feeling lost about my career path and my future. I applied to college as Mechanical Engineering major just like other typical STEM-oriented students. Everything changes after I realized coding was truly my first passion. While I craved for more knowledge, I did realize my learning process was slow and lacked of focus. That was when I decided to jumpstart my technical skillset with a summer bootcamp.</p>
              <p>Since I did study a little Spanish in high school and college, I decided to attend a 9-week Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp in Barcelona, Spain to explore the culture as well. I learned Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL stack and led a team of four to build a website named Buddy Up that matches people based on personalities and interests on a 1-on-1 basis. While I was the youngest of the batch, I demonstrated maturity, great adaptation in new environment and leadership in team projects. The experience was beyond amazing and it was indeed the catalyst I need for my quest of conquering software development world.</p>
              <p>Having a sharp understanding of how the web works and how different components like server, database and various front-end tools connect to each other, I started applying for a lot of different student developer positions, hoping to gain working experience. Fortunately, I got an offer and started working as Student Web and Application Developer for the Department of Medical Physics. While I was the youngest applicant with no prior knowledge of PHP and MySQL, my enthusiasm for coding as well as my soft skills probably helped me get the job. I demonstrated my quick learning of new development stack through learning PHP, MySQL and WordPress on the go.</p>
              <p>As I challenge myself everyday to learn and grow more, I aim to leverage my skills to good use and build products that serve the communities around me. I seek joy coding and working with others in the Coding for Good organization at my university where I am working on Culture Project - Explore Madison website aiming to encourage students' engagements with university/community events. Currently taking online React course, I am constantly learning new things to fulfill my dream of becoming a software developer in a near future. <a href="#about" onClick={this.goToAboutAndToggle}>See less</a></p>
